# LeetCode-Style Problem Annotations

This repository contains five carefully selected algorithmic problems implemented in Python. Each solution includes clear annotations to explain logic, design decisions, and time/space complexity.

The goal: showcase clarity, precision, and problem-solving skill â€” as expected in technical roles requiring data annotation and algorithm understanding.

## ðŸ§  Problems Covered

1. `two_sum_explained.py` â€” Hash table solution for classic Two Sum problem  
2. `valid_parentheses_traced.py` â€” Stack-based approach to check balanced parentheses  
3. `merge_sorted_arrays.py` â€” Merging two sorted arrays in O(n) time  
4. `max_subarray_kadane.py` â€” Kadaneâ€™s algorithm for maximum subarray sum  
5. `reverse_linked_list_steps.py` â€” Iterative and recursive reversal of a singly linked list
