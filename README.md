# LeetCode-Style Problem Annotations

This repository contains five carefully selected algorithmic problems implemented in Python. Each solution includes clear annotations to explain logic, design decisions, and time/space complexity.

The goal: showcase clarity, precision, and problem-solving skill â€” as expected in technical roles requiring data annotation and algorithm understanding.

## ðŸ§  Problems Covered

1. **Two Sum** â€“ Uses a hash map for O(n) lookup  
2. **Valid Parentheses** â€“ Tracks brackets with a stack  
3. **Merge Sorted Arrays** â€“ Combines two sorted arrays in linear time  
4. **Maximum Subarray (Kadaneâ€™s)** â€“ Finds max sum in O(n)  
5. **Reverse Linked List** â€“ Iterative reversal using pointers
